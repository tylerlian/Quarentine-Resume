# Quarentine Resume
Wanted an easier alternative to share my resume at career fairs because of Covid-19

Feel free to use the source code to share your resume!

## Usage
```javascript

// In the imports just change to picture of your resume (Resume.js)
import Background from '../(your_resume_here.jpg)'

// Change the download pdf to your resume! (Button.js)
<a href='(your-resume-name-here.pdf)' download='(your-resume-name-here)' className='btn-mobile'>
```
